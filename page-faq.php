					<h2>Boosting</h2>
					<div class="accordion" data-accordion data-allow-all-closed="true">
						<div class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>    <a href="#" class="accordion-title"><h3>What boosting services are offered and what they consist on?</h3></a>
							<div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content><p>The services we offer are the following:<br><br> <strong>Solo Boost:</strong> The booster logs into your account and plays the games for you. For this service your account name and password is required. <br> <strong>Duo Boost:</strong> The booster plays with you in Duo Queue with his own smurf account with a similar rank to yours.  For this service you don’t have to give your account name and password.<br><br>
								Once you choose which type of service you must also choose how we must complete the order. We offer the following options: <br> <br>
<strong>Division Boost:</strong> You choose a league and a division and the booster will play with your account (solo boost) or with you (Duo boost) until it reaches the desired league and division.
<br>
<strong>Net Wins:</strong>In a Net Wins Boost, you choose the number of net wins you want and the booster will play until the total number of purchased net wins is reached. A net win is calculated by the number of victories minus the number of defeats. This means that if you asked for one net win and for whatever reason our booster loses one game, he will have to win a total of two games to fulfill the order. Another example: 10 victories and 3 defeats give a total of 7 net wins.<br>
<strong>Placement Matches:</strong> We guarantee a 66% win ratio in placements games and you will be compensated by getting 2 net wins for each defeat that is below that percentage. This means that if you buy 10 placement matches you will get at least 7 wins. <br>
<strong>Normal Wins(Solo Boost):</strong>A booster will log into your account and play normal games until he reaches the amount of wins you purchased. We do not offer any net wins for this service.<br>
<strong>Games(Duo Boost):</strong>You will play games with one of our boosters, without a guaranteed division boost or a number of wins. While an improvement in your rank is not guaranteed, our booster will play their best and most of the times a greater increase in your rank is achieved because of the awesome win ratio our booster always achieve.<br>

						<div class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>    <a href="#" class="accordion-title"><h3>What division are your boosters? Can I know the main account of my booster?</h3></a>
							<div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content><p>Our booster can’t reveal their main account identity but they can tell you their rank. All our boosters are at least Diamond I.</p></div>
						</div>
						<div class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>    <a href="#" class="accordion-title"><h3>Can I ask for a specific booster to complete my order?</h3></a>
							<div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content><p>Of course, but we can't ensure his availability at that moment. To do this, before you start the order go inside your dashboard and fill the field “Notes to Booster” with the name of the booster you want. Another option is to send a message from the dashboard to the administrator and ask for a specific booster assignation or ask or the availability of the booster you want.</p></div>
						</div>
						<div class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>    <a href="#" class="accordion-title"><h3>Can I request my order to be played with only specifics champions or lanes?</h3></a>
							<div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content><p>Yes, you can specify the lanes and the champions that will be used to complete your order. We do not recommend to choose champs outside of the metagame because the boosters may take more time to complete your order. If you do ask for a specific champion/lane that is not in the metagame, for example, Urgot, know that it will be harder for our boosters and the order will take more time. But don't worry, our boosters can do it!</p></div>
						</div>
						<div class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>    <a href="#" class="accordion-title"><h3>Can I ask to change my booster while the order is in progress?</h3></a>
							<div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content><p>Yes, make a request to the administrator on the chat located on your dashboard.</p></div>
						</div>
						<div class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>    <a href="#" class="accordion-title"><h3>Can I access or play on my account during the time my order is in progress?</h3></a>
							<div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content><p>If it's a solo order please confirm that your booster isn’t active by the time you log in and ask him to log out as soon as he finishes his game.
If the order is a Duo Boost: You can log in to your account without any problem.
Please remember not to play ranked if you have a division service.</p></div>
						</div>
						<div class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>    <a href="#" class="accordion-title"><h3>Is there any restrictions by the time my order is paused?</h3></a>
							<div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content><p>We recommend to only pause the order when you really need.
After 48 hours your order will be automatically unassigned by the system, and when you start it again a new booster will be assigned. This can only happen twice, and it cannot be paused more than 14 days. If any of this happens you must contact an administrator to create a new order for you, and if your rank it’s different than before your order will be adjusted.</p></div>

					<h2>Payments and Security</h2>
					<div class="accordion" data-accordion data-allow-all-closed="true">
						<div class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>    <a href="#" class="accordion-title"><h3>What security do you offer for my payment information and other sensitive data?</h3></a>
							<div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content><p>Every single bit of information you share with us is encrypted using a 256 bits SSL certificate. Also for your security, all payments are handled by PayPal, so we have no access to any of your private information.</p></div>
						</div>
						<div class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>    <a href="#" class="accordion-title"><h3>What is your refund policy?</h3></a>
							<div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content><p>Refunds can be made if the order never started or the booster didn’t play any match. If the order was in progress and some games were played, refunds will only be done in a case by case basis. For example, if the booster does something improper or is taking too much time to finish your order. We reserve the right to refuse any refund we consider is not justified. For more information please read our terms and conditions.</p></div>
						</div>
						<div class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>    <a href="#" class="accordion-title"><h3>Do you accept credit cards or another payment option?</h3></a>
							<div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content><p>You can pay using any credit card with PayPal. It takes less than 5 minutes to create and setup a new account. At the moment we do not offer any other payment option but we plan to do it soon!</p></div>
						</div>

						<div class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>    <a href="#" class="accordion-title"><h3> What security measures do you use to guarantee my account security?</h3></a>
							<div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content><p>Is not possible to steal accounts since every account has a specific email associated with it. Only the owner has access to it, so your account is always recoverable. Regardless, each of our boosters has passed a strict review and a trial period before they get access to any of your account information.</p></div>
						</div>
						<div class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>    <a href="#" class="accordion-title"><h3>What about getting banned?</h3></a>
							<div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content><p>We have a series of security measures to be sure every boost is not detected by Riot. We can tell about some of them, but we prefer to keep most of them private so Riot doesn't know exactly what we do. Also, we need your help to ensure this and we have text inside the dashboard indicating what you should and shouldn't do. For example:
								<ul>
								<li>You should never log in while the boost is in process.</li>
								<li>If you pause the order, then you have to wait at least 1 hour before log in to your account.</li></ul></p></div>
